        <h2>Origins</h2>
                <p>On that one Thursday, yes, Thursday, Ryan Nees and Alex Geier were assigned to create a webpage to define humankind. Sadly, we settled on BBQ sauce. Luckily, with long hours spent researching organic mutations and mixing various organic compounds, we were able to create the greatest condiment known to all life forms within the known and expanding universe.</p>

        <h2>Downfall</h2>
            <p>We are in college, and we are broke. We have so little money, we owe the internet money. All leftover sauce after our liquidation sale was donated to Madagascar. We got lost in the sauce.</p>

        <h2>Where Are We Now?</h2>
            <p>Well, we are still in college, still broke, and still stressing over our futures in the BBQ sauce business. We are currently taking donations to relive our dreams. For donating $1 a day, you could have your own name on a bottle of our patented, Celebrity Doug's Classic BBQ Sauce. Every cent matters.</p>
