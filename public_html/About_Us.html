        <h2>Origins</h2>
                <p>On that one Thursday, yes, Thursday, Ryan Nees and Alex Geier were assigned to create a webpage to define humankind. Sadly, we settled on BBQ sauce. Luckily, with long hours spent researching organic mutations and mixing various organic compounds, we were able to create the greatest condiment known to all life forms within the known and expanding universe.</p>

        <h2>Downfall</h2>
            <p>We are in college, and we are broke. We have so little money, we owe the internet money. All leftover sauce after our liquidation sale was donated to Madagascar. We got lost in the sauce.</p>

        <h2>Where Are We Now?</h2>
            <p>Well, we are still in college, still broke, and still stressing over our futures in the BBQ sauce business. We are currently taking donations to relive our dreams. For donating $1 a day, you could have your own name on a bottle of our patented, Celebrity Doug's Classic BBQ Sauce. Every cent matters.</p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p> We plan on getting back on the grind very soon! We would like for there to be at least one of our restaurants in every single state and country in the world. These goals may seem a little too ambitious, but our mamas always told us to shoot for the stars. We also intend on expanding our products. We want to explore the seafood industry as well. We are looking open our first seafood restaurant in early 2018. The location is to be determined, but make sure to be on the look out! If you have any suggestions for us, feel free to contact us anytime! </p>
